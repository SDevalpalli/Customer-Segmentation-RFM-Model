# RFM segmentation model #
The business objective of this project was to increase the conversion rate of emails to purchases using a suitable customer segmentation model on existing users who opted to receive emails to improve marketing efforts via personalised email recommendations. The choice of segmentation used was a modified RFM model.
The tools used in this project are as follows:
* SQL using BigQuery
* Microsoft Power BI
* Microsoft Powerpoint

Along with the customer segmentation for email marketing, the below KPIs were calculated for each segment to compare how customer behaviour changed over time:
* Total Revenue per segment
* No. of customers per segment who opted for email.
* Average email conversion rate.

Below is a schema of how the customer base was segmented via the recency, frequency and monetary elements of RFM.

* Ranked each section 1-5.
* Recency - the date of a customerâ€™s last order.
* Frequency - the total number of transactions per customer.
* Monetary - total revenue generated per customer.  

Score | Recency | Description
:---: | :---------: | :---------------------------:
  1   | 1st 20%  |  Most Recent
  2   | 2nd 20% |  Relatively Recent
  3   | 3rd 20% |  Somewhat Recent
  4   | 4th  20% |  Less Recent
  5   | 5th 20%  |  Not Recent
  

Score | Frequency | Description
:---: | :----------: | :---------------------------:
  1   | Top 5%    |  Most Frequent
  2   | Top  20% |  Relatively Frequent
  3   | Top 30% |  Somewhat Frequent
  4   | Top 60% |  Less Frequent
  5   | Bottom   |  Not Frequent
  

Score | Monetary | Description
:---: | :----------: | :---------------------------:
  1   | Top 5%    |  Most Money
  2   | Top  20% |  High Money
  3   | Top 30% |  Medium Money
  4   | Top 60% |  Low Money
  5   | Bottom   |  Lowest Money
  
  
Using this scoring system we could segment the customers and personalise recommendations for these separate groups to increase the conversion rate from email to purchase.
